##Description

More humans = more waste. This is a constant -- it has always been, and will always be. The problem is that the human population continues to grow, with no forseeable ceiling, while the amount of waste our planet can handle is steadily approaching its limit. Concurrently, the gap between those who have and those who have not is growing wider and wider. 

Many of us throw unwanted, but perfectly functional, items in our garbage bin without a second thought -- things that fill up our landfills and pollute our environment. Too many impoverished people lack simple things like appliances, electronics, furniture, etc, that would make their lives easier. 

These people can solve each others' problems, but they lack a connection. TakeMyThings is that connection.'

TakeMyThings is a website/application that seeks to connect people who have things they no longer want or need to people who could use those things. This application allows users (givers) to list things they no longer want in a quick and highly efficient manner. On the other side, the application allows users who are in need of things (takers) to search for and/or browse free things in their area.

TMT's goals are threefold:

1. To streamline the process of connecting people to one another in a way that benefits both parties
2. To reduce waste , both in our homes, and especially in our landfills
3. To provide a fun user experience -- finding free things should be like a treasure hunt!

TakeMyThings primary strength is its universal appeal. Everyone has things in their garage, storage locker, closet, etc. that they no longer need. They just lack the motivation to do something about it. Oftentimes we notice this stuff when we're moving or doing some spring cleaning.'

This is especially true when it comes to furniture. The city's policies on disposing of unwanted furniture are a bit quirky. And those people who would like to donate their furniture to places like Goodwill often don't have the means (a truck) to get their stuff there.' So furniture often ends up getting dumped by the dumpster in apartment complexes or office buildings (which is illegal!) or sitting in an empty lot until it ultimately ends up in a landfill. 

TMT simplifies the process of connecting those who want to quickly get rid of unwanted things to those who want or need those things!

##APIs, Plugins, Libraries and Frameworks

This app will be heavily reliant upon Google Maps API. JS Validate plugin will be used -- other plugins TBD. Primary frameworks include jQuery, React, and the Google Web Toolkit. Backbone library will also be used. Apache Cordova will be used to convert site to a mobile app platform (if time allows...).
